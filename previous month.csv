So a total of 340 ML has been infused to the patient.
After Pharmacy discovered this error, an immediate correction was done on the internal IP preparation form. 
Reason: the Chimio® software, in the version Pharmacy has, does not take into account the modification for patients already included. It is therefore a computer alert that has been issued to warn preparers about the volume to be prepared.
